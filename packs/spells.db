The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li><li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li><li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn).
